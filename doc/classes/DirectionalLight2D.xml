		Directional light from a distance.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A directional light is a type of [Light2D] node that models an infinite number of parallel rays covering the entire scene. It is used for lights with strong intensity that are located far away from the scene (for example: to model sunlight or moonlight).

		<member name="height" type="float" setter="set_height" getter="get_height" default="0.0">
			The height of the light. Used with 2D normal mapping. Ranges from 0 (parallel to the plane) to 1 (perpendicular to the plane).
		</member>
		<member name="max_distance" type="float" setter="set_max_distance" getter="get_max_distance" default="10000.0">
			Maximum distance this light covers. Increasing this value will make directional shadows visible from further away, at the cost of lower overall shadow detail and performance (due to more objects being included in shadow rendering).
