		Sprite node that contains multiple textures as frames to play for animation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[AnimatedSprite2D] is similar to the [Sprite2D] node, except it carries multiple textures as animation frames. Animations are created using a [SpriteFrames] resource, which allows you to import image files (or a folder containing said files) to provide the animation frames for the sprite. The [SpriteFrames] resource can be configured in the editor via the SpriteFrames bottom panel.
		After setting up [member frames], [method play] may be called. It's also possible to select an [member animation] and toggle [member playing], even within the editor.
		To pause the current animation, call [method stop] or set [member playing] to [code]false[/code]. Alternatively, setting [member speed_scale] to [code]0[/code] also preserves the current frame's elapsed time.
		[b]Note:[/b] You can associate a set of normal or specular maps by creating additional [SpriteFrames] resources with a [code]_normal[/code] or [code]_specular[/code] suffix. For example, having 3 [SpriteFrames] resources [code]run[/code], [code]run_normal[/code], and [code]run_specular[/code] will make it so the [code]run[/code] animation uses normal and specular maps.

			<param index="0" name="anim" type="StringName" default="&amp;&quot;&quot;" />
			<param index="1" name="backwards" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Plays the animation named [param anim]. If no [param anim] is provided, the current animation is played. If [param backwards] is [code]true[/code], the animation is played in reverse.

		<method name="stop">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Stops the current [member animation] at the current [member frame].
				[b]Note:[/b] This method resets the current frame's elapsed time. If this behavior is undesired, consider setting [member speed_scale] to [code]0[/code], instead.

	<members>
		<member name="animation" type="StringName" setter="set_animation" getter="get_animation" default="&amp;&quot;default&quot;">
			The current animation from the [member frames] resource. If this value changes, the [code]frame[/code] counter is reset.
		</member>
		<member name="centered" type="bool" setter="set_centered" getter="is_centered" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], texture will be centered.
		</member>
		<member name="flip_h" type="bool" setter="set_flip_h" getter="is_flipped_h" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], texture is flipped horizontally.
		</member>
		<member name="flip_v" type="bool" setter="set_flip_v" getter="is_flipped_v" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], texture is flipped vertically.
		</member>
		<member name="frame" type="int" setter="set_frame" getter="get_frame" default="0">
			The displayed animation frame's index.
		</member>
		<member name="frames" type="SpriteFrames" setter="set_sprite_frames" getter="get_sprite_frames">
			The [SpriteFrames] resource containing the animation(s). Allows you the option to load, edit, clear, make unique and save the states of the [SpriteFrames] resource.
		</member>
		<member name="offset" type="Vector2" setter="set_offset" getter="get_offset" default="Vector2(0, 0)">
			The texture's drawing offset.
		</member>
		<member name="playing" type="bool" setter="set_playing" getter="is_playing" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the [member animation] is currently playing. Setting this property to [code]false[/code] is the equivalent of calling [method stop].
		</member>
		<member name="speed_scale" type="float" setter="set_speed_scale" getter="get_speed_scale" default="1.0">
			The animation speed is multiplied by this value. If set to a negative value, the animation is played in reverse. If set to [code]0[/code], the animation is paused, preserving the current frame's elapsed time.
		</member>

	<signals>
		<signal name="animation_finished">
			<description>
				Emitted when the animation is finished (when it plays the last frame). If the animation is looping, this signal is emitted every time the last frame is drawn.
			</description>
		</signal>
		<signal name="frame_changed">
			<description>
				Emitted when [member frame] changed.
